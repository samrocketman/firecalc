	<h1 style="font-weight:normal">Power Functions</h1>

	<p>Now we discuss power functions. Look at the picture below for a list of the power function buttons:</p>

	<p><img alt="pow-fxns" src="pow.png"></p>

	<p>The first power function we shall go over is most likely the hardest to comprehend for a new user at first. It is the <span style="color:red">x^y</span> button. Some may get confused as to how this works because when they click it what appears in the Display is &quot;^&quot;. This is actually just an easy way for you to write an equation.</p>

	<p><b>Examples of &quot;x^y&quot; functions:</b></p>

	<p>x^y is the same thing as X<sup>Y</sup>.<br>2<sup>3</sup>=8 is the same as 2^3=8<br>Putting it in a more complex equation is no problem either:<br>4(2<sup>3</sup>+4)=48 which is like 4*(2^3+4)</p>

	<p><em>Don't forget the a symbol goes between 2 algebraic functions like (8)*(8)<br>Also all parenthesis have to be closed in order for any function to work</em></p>

	<p><b>Moving on...</b></p>

	<p>After learning that understanding the rest is no problem.</p>

	<p><b>sqrt</b> takes the square route of the current Equation which is basically x^(1/2)</p>

	<p><b>x^2</b> squares the current Equation</p>

	<p>and <b>x^3</b> cubes the current Equation</p>
