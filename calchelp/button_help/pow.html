	<h1 style="font-weight:normal">Power Functions</h1>

	<p>Now we discuss power functions.Look at the picture below for a list of the power function buttons:</p>

	<p><img alt="pow-fxns" src="pow.png"></p>

	<p>The first power function we shall go over is most likely the hardest to comprehend.It is the X^Y function.Some may get confused as to how this works because when they click it what appears in the Display is &quot;pow(&quot;.This is actually just setting you up to finish writing it.</p>

	<p><b>Exampes of &quot;pow()&quot; functions:</b></p>

	<p>x^y is the same thing as X<sup>Y</sup> which is also the same as pow(x,y);<br>2<sup>3</sup>=8 is the same as pow(2,3)=8<br>Putting it in a more complex equation is no problem either:<br>4(2<sup>3</sup>+4)=48 which is like 4*(pow(2,3)+4)</p>

	<p><em>Don't forget the a symbol goes between 2 algebraic functions like (8)*(8)<br>Also all parenthensis have to be closed in order for any function to work</em></p>

	<p><b>Moving on...</b></p>

	<p>After learning that understanding the rest is no problem.</p>

	<p><b>sqrt</b> takes the square route of the current Equation which is basically<br>pow(x,(1/2))</p>

	<p><b>x^2</b> squares the current Equation pow(x,2)</p>

	<p>and <b>x^3</b> cubes the current Equation pow(x,3)</p>
