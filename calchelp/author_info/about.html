	<p>Hello! My name is Sam Gleske. I am 21 years old and do JavaScript programming as a hobby. I am a Computer Engineering student at Drexel University. Other hobbies include community activities such as being involved with Boy Scouts (now as a role model rather than a scout). I also enjoy rebuilding racing motors of motocross bikes (I race and am my own mechanic) and tuning the overall performance of the bike for track conditions. I love to work with my hands on any type of project and am motivated to achieve greatness.</p>

	<p>I have a couple of nationally recognized certifications for diagnosing and fixing personal computers as well as an extended knowledge of implemented network structures.</p>
	
	<p>My programming experience includes the following languages: AutoCAD, CSS, C++, C#, DHTML, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Labview, Linux Shell, Maple, Neuron C, NSIS, UPMACS, Windows Batch, XHTML, XML.</p>
