# Scientific Calculator WebUI

I say partially abandoned because I actually use this calculator regularly (as a
bookmarked web page) to run quick calculations in my browser.  I have it load
into the Firefox sidebar as a bookmark.  I've had no need to update it since
2011 so there has been no development since then.

### About

It is a semi-advanced web calculator that uses JavaScript to compute math
equations.  It uses [computeobject.js][co.js] under the hood.
